    <p>Adani Exports Limited started as a commodity trading company in 1988 and expanded into importing and exporting multiple commodities. With a capital of ₹5 lakhs, the company was established as a partnership firm with the flagship company Adani Enterprises, previously Adani Exports.[12] In 1990, the Adani Group developed its own port in Mundra to provide a base for its trading operations. It began construction at Mundra in 1995. In 1998, it became the top net foreign exchange earner for India Inc.[13] The company began coal trading in 1999, followed by a joint venture in edible oil refining in 2000 with the formation of Adani Wilmar.[14]</p>
    <p>The Adani group became India's largest private coal mining company after Adani Enterprises won the Orissa mine rights in 2010.[15] Operations at the Port of Dahej commenced in 2011 and its capacity subsequently grew to 20 Mt. The company also bought Galilee Basin mine in Australia with 10.4 gigatonnes (Gt) of coal reserves.

The port began operations in May 2011 and handled a total cargo of 14.3 Mt in 2013–14.[20] With the acquisition of Dhamra Port, the Group is planning to increase its capacity to over 200 Mt by 2020.[21][22]</p>
